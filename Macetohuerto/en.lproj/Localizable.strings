It forms a compact head, formed by immature inflorescences, of 2-3 kg. The colour is usually white but it may also be orange, green or purple. It tastes smooth and sometimes slightly sweet.\n\n\n\n<b> Physiology of the cauliflower</b>\n\n\n\nIt is a very peculiar kind of crop because its development is influenced by different parameters. In the growth of cauliflowers 3 phases are distinguished:\n\n\n\n\n● The Juvenile phase which begins with the germination and producing only vegetation throughout it. In summer cauliflowers this phase lasts 5-8 weeks and they form 5-7 leaves, in those in Autumn this phase lasts 5-8 weeks and they form 12-15 leaves and the ones in winter lasts 10-15 weeks and form 20-30 leaves.\n\n\n\n\n● The Floral Induction phase, which by the action of low temperatures induces the formation of the head. Vernalizing temperatures for winter cauliflowers go from 6-10 ° C during 5-15 weeks depending on the cycle, for autumn cauliflowers, between 8-15 ° C during 2-5 weeks and the summer ones above 15 º C.\n\n\n\n\n● Head formation phase, time in which the plant stops making leaves and the smaller ones cover the head. The temperature strongly affects the growth of the head: zero growth is between 3-5 ° C, while a temperature rise of 3-4 ° C increases production by an 80%.

Try curly basil, Dark Opal basil and the traditional Genovese. Also  the tiny leaves of the bush basil are very tasty as well as lovely to look at.\n\n\nBasil needs a warm and sunny spot to thrive. Six to eight hours of direct sunlight is perfect, though if you live in a really hot climate you may want to give your basil some afternoon shade. For basil to really take off, the soil and air needs to be fairly warm, so don't rush putting out your plants in the spring. Wait until about two weeks after your last frost before putting out your plants and don't forget to harden them off.\n        \n\nYou really can grow basil in almost anything. All kinds of containers will work, including a kiddie pool and the laundry basket pictured above. However, basil likes room so air can circulate around the plants. It also doesn't like to dry out completely so use as big a pot as you can. You don't want to crowd your plants, though if you are making your pot for looks as well as function, you can put them closer than the recommended 12-18 inches apart. Try them more like 6-8 inches apart. Basil is prone to fungus so keeping airflow between plants is important.\n\n\nMake sure your pot has plenty of drainage and that you use a high quality potting soil. Basil doesn't like to be too wet, so you want to keep your soil moist not soggy. Try using fabric pots like the Smart Pots pictured above. For a more finished look, you can put the smart pot in a larger vessel like this red laundry basket for a pop of color.\n        \n\nBasil is incredibly easy to start from seed. You can direct seed or start your seeds inside about a month before your last frost date (you will want to set them outside about 2 weeks after your last frost date). Basil needs some light to germinate, so don't plant the seeds too deeply—only 1/4\" deep. Temperatures around 70°F are perfect, but you have some flexibility with the temperature. Plants will germinate from 5-10 days.\n\n\nTransplant carefully when the plants have 3-4 sets of leaves.\n\n\nYou can also root basil in water. Take the stem of a plant and put it in a clear vase or glass of water. When roots appear you can transplant out (after hardening off) into your pot.\n    \n\nBasil is picky about water. It doesn't like to be too dry or too wet, so make sure not to let your pot dry out because if you do, your basil may be toast. To know if you should add water to your pot, stick your finger down into the soil about up to the second knuckle. If the soil feels dryish, add water.\n\n\nMix in an organic fertilizer to the potting soil when you plant. Before you do this, make sure to read the label on your potting soil to make sure that it doesn't have fertilizer already in it. Add add a diluted liquid fertilizer ever couple of weeks.\n \n\nSource: https://www.thespruce.com/growing-basil-in-containers-848215";

There really is nothing like the taste of a fresh-picked strawberry still warm from the sun - it's like a mouthful of magic. Strawberries are also beautiful—a great example of a plant that is as ornamental as it is edible.\n\n\nHere's what you need to know to get started growing strawberries in pots\n\n\nChoosing a Pot – Strawberry pots (usually tall pots that have pockets) are, not surprisingly, perfect for growing strawberries.\n\n\nYou can fit several plants in one pot. A strawberry pot is a particularly great way to grow strawberries if space is a consideration. Strawberries also look lovely in hanging baskets or ceramic pots. Whatever type of garden pot you use, make sure that it has good drainage.\n\n\nChoosing Strawberry Plants – There are four different types of strawberry plants, June bearing, everbearing, day neutral and alpine. Alpine, day neutral and ever-bearing provide a longer harvest season. The alpines and day neutral are particularly lovely to look at - bearing small, bright red, tasty berries all season long. Even if your strawberries are in pots, some plants will spread even beyond the pot, so if you don't want strawberries to spread into your lawn or garden beds, make sure to prune and plants that are getting out of hand.\n\n\nPlanting Strawberries in Pots – In early spring, fill your container with a good quality potting soil, adding a slow-release fertilizer, (first check if the potting mix has it already mixed in).\n\n\nPlant your strawberries just deep enough so that the soil level of the nursery pot is at the same level as your potting soil. Be careful not to put soil over the crown of your plant (which is where the plant meets the soil).\n\n\nCaring for Strawberries – Most strawberry plants will produce most fruit if they are in full sun, though some varieties of alpines and day neutral strawberries will tolerate part shade.\n\n\nAll strawberries need consistent water to thrive. Keep the soil moist, not wet. If possible, water in the morning or during the day, not in the evening, to prevent disease. Always test your soil for moisture before watering by sticking your finger in up to the second knuckle. If the soil feels dry, add water. Fertilize with a diluted liquid fertilizer every other week. Try an organic fish emulsion, seaweed combination.\n\n\nOverwintering Strawberry Pots – If you live in a cold weather zone, move your strawberry containers into a protected area – preferably from 30-40°F. Check plants weekly, giving them just enough water so they don't dry out completely. Place them outside in the spring.\n\n\nSource: https://www.thespruce.com/growing-strawberries-in-pots-848167";

Proper watering is the key to growing potted rosemary herbs, and the best way to determine if the plant needs water is to insert your finger into the soil. If the top 1 to 2 inches of soil feels dry, it's time to water. Water the plant deeply, then let the pot drain freely and never let the pot stand in water. Use care, as overwatering is the most common reason rosemary plants don't survive in containers.\n        \n\nRosemary in pots generally doesn't require fertilizer, but you can use a dry fertilizer or a dilute solution of a water-soluble liquid fertilizer if the plant looks pale green or growth is stunted. Again, use care, as too much fertilizer may damage the plant. Too little fertilizer is always better than too much. Always water the rosemary immediately after applying fertilizer. Be sure to apply fertilizer to the potting soil – not the leaves.\n        \n\nKeeping a rosemary plant alive during the winter can be tricky. If you decide to bring your plant indoors during the winter, it will need a bright location.

"cilantro_descripcion" = "Coriander is a versatile herb popular in Asian cooking including curries, Chinese and Thai dishes. Both the seeds and the leaves of the plant can be used, and offer two distinct flavours. The seeds have a slight lemony flavour; they are often ground and used as a spice. The leaves (also known as cilantro) have a slightly bitter taste and can be chopped up and added to dishes and breads or used as a garnish.\n\n\nGermination of coriander takes up to 3 weeks. Thin young plants to 20cm apart to allow them to grow to their full size. Water them in dry periods and ensure the soil never dries out. If flowers develop remove them immediately – this ensures the plants focus their energy on growing new leaves. Re-sow coriander every three weeks to ensure you have a continual supply during the summer. It is not normally necessary to feed coriander if the soil is well nourished. However, if the plants appear to be suffering give them a liquid organic feed to perk them up.\n        \n\nCoriander does well in containers and can be grown on a sunny windowsill or balcony. The container must be quite deep as coriander has a long taproot. Scatter seeds on the surface of the compost and cover with soil, watering well. Care for the plants as you would if they were in the ground; you may need to water them more often as pots dry quickly.\n\n\nHarvest the leaves when the plant is big and robust enough to cope. Pluck or cut each leaf off the stem or snip whole stems if necessary. Both the leaves and the stalks can be used.\n\n\nIf you are growing coriander for its seeds, wait until the flowers have died off before harvesting. Cut the stems and place the heads of the coriander in a paper bag, with the stems slicking out. Tie the stems and the bag together in a bunch and hang upside down in a cool, dry place.

"oregano_descripcion" = "I think the Greeks got it right when they described oregano as \"joy of the mountain.\" This aromatic, ancient culinary herb, also referred to as \"wild marjoram,\" originates from the hilly, Greek countryside, and is now grown all over the world.\n\n\nOregano is a must-have in a culinary garden. Its pungent, spicy, slightly bitter flavor pairs well with almost any vegetable preparation. And just as easy to grow as chives, oregano is another go-to for the first-time gardener.\n\n\n<b>How to Cultivate Oregano</b>\n        \n\nSoil: Plant oregano in light, well-drained soil. Oregano actually grows better in moderately fertile soil, so no fertilization or addition of compost is necessary. I let my oregano do what it does on its own. My only complaint might be that I can't keep up with the harvest!\n\n\nSun: Oregano performs well in part to full sun, but the flavors intensify when it receives a full day of sunshine. Oregano will grow well indoors, but it is important that the plant receives adequate heat and sunshine in order to grow.\n\n\nWater: Don't overwater oregano. Water thoroughly, only when the soil is dry to the touch.\n\n\nSpacing: Plant oregano eight to 10 inches apart in your garden. Oregano grows up to two feet tall and spans about 18 inches across. If you are planting oregano in a container, be sure the pot is about 12 inches in diameter; oregano is a prolific grower. If you're limited on space, read this post on creating a small-space kitchen herb garden.\n\n\nCompanion planting: Oregano is a great companion plant to almost anything, so don't worry about planting it next to something it won't get along with. I plant oregano alongside my tomatoes and peppers. Oregano keeps away a tomato's archenemy, aphids, by means of predation. Aphids actually love oregano, but oregano also attracts syrphidae (flower flies), which then dine upon the small bugs. Oregano's thick foliage also provides humidity, which supports peppers' growth.\n        \n\n<b>How to Harvest Oregano</b>\n\n\nHarvesting oregano couldn't be simpler. You may harvest oregano once the stems are at least four inches tall. I tend to let mine grow to about eight inches tall, and then I cut back up to 2/3 of the plant. Reference the photo above and cut just above the leaves. And don't worry if you think you've cut back your oregano too much — regular trimming encourages new growth and prevents \"legginess.\"\n\n\n\nTip: Want to know the easiest way to harvest oregano? If you won't be drying your oregano by the bunch, and you only need the leaves, simply grab the stem about 2/3 down the length of the plant and run your fingers along the stem. The leaves will collect in your hand, and then all you'll have to do afterwards is trim the now-leafless stem. Eureka!\n\n\nTo obtain the optimum potency of flavor, harvest oregano leaves just before the plant flowers, if you can time it perfectly. Even the subtly flavored flowers are great topped on salads. Otherwise, either clip as needed or, as I do, trim your oregano plants all at once and turn on the dehydrator. More on what to do with your oregano when we discuss the best way to preserve your harvest in tomorrow's post.\n\n\nSource: http://www.thekitchn.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-growing-oregano-220612";

These plants naturally grow vertically without support, making them a suitable addition to a space-saving container garden. Brussels sprouts grow best in cool weather, and they may fail to form sprouts if it's too hot. They take about 90 days to produce sprouts, so gardeners often plant them in early summer for a fall crop or in early spring so they can mature before the heat of summer.\n\n\nFill a 12-inch diameter, 12-inch deep pot with potting soil.

Place the pot in a location that receives full, all-day sunlight immediately after planting.\n\n\nFeel the soil in the container at least once a day. Water when the top 1 inch of soil feels dry. Soil dries out more quickly in a container, and brussels sprouts may require daily watering during hot or dry weather.\n\n\nDissolve 1 tablespoon of 15-30-15 soluble fertilizer in 1 gallon of water. Water the brussels sprouts with the solution every two weeks, beginning about six weeks after transplanting. Frequent watering leaches fertilizer from the container, so regular reapplications ensure the plant gets the necessary nutrients to produce well.\n\n\nPull off the bottom six to eight leaves on the plant's stalk when it begins to develop sprouts, which allows the plant to focus more energy on sprout development. Cut off the top of the stalk, below the growing point near the tip, when the sprouts are forming but about half their mature size.\n\n\nTwist the brusssels sprouts from the main stalk when they reach their mature size of 1 to 2 inches in diameter.

Just layer organic materials—garden clippings, dry leaves, kitchen vegetable scraps, shredded paper—and a dash of soil to create a concoction that turns into humus, the best soil builder around.\n    \n\nTo create your own organic hot-compost heap, wait until you have enough materials to make a pile at least 3 feet deep. Then, to ensure an even composition of materials, create alternating 4- to 8-inch-deep layers of green materials (kitchen scraps, fresh leaves, coffee grounds) and brown materials (dried leaves, shredded paper, untreated sawdust).\n        \n\nSprinkle water over the pile regularly so it has the consistency of a damp sponge. Don't add too much water—otherwise the microorganisms in your pile will become waterlogged and drown. If this happens, your pile will rot instead of compost.\n        \n\nCheck to see if your pile is decomposing by monitoring temperature. Check the temperature of the pile with a thermometer, or simply reach into the middle of the pile with your hand.\n    \n\nDuring the growing season, you should provide the pile with oxygen by turning it once a week with a garden fork. The best time to turn the compost is when the center of the pile feels warm or the thermometer reads between 130 and 150 degrees Fahrenheit. Stirring up the pile helps it cook faster and prevents material from becoming matted down and developing a bad odor. At this point, the layers have served their purpose of creating equal amounts of green and brown materials throughout the pile, so stir thoroughly.\n        \n\nWhen the compost no longer gives off heat and becomes dry, brown, and crumbly, it's fully cooked and ready to feed to the garden.\n        \n\nThese are a list of materials that you can use into your compost pile:";

"rucula_desc" = "Growing arugula is incredibly easy to grow and is one of the spiciest and most delicious greens available. A huge bonus is that arugula flowers are stunningly beautiful and one of the best tasting edible flowers out there.\n\n\nChoosing a container - Since the roots of arugula are relatively shallow, you don't need a giant, or particularly deep container. However, you'll want to plant a fair amount of arugula, because once you get a taste for it, you might find you're eating a lot of it.\n        \n\nThough you can grow arugula in almost anything, a self-watering container works particularly well.\n        \n\nPlanting Arugula - Like most salad greens, arugula seeds are tiny, so you have to be careful not to plant them too deep. Fill your garden pot up with potting mix, then gently flatten it out with your hand. Then distribute the seeds as uniformly as possible onto the potting mix. Take your palm and gently pat the seeds onto the soil. You can then cover them lightly with potting soil, or put a thin layer of seed starting mix over the seeds, gently patting again. Add water very carefully, either using a rose attachment, or a gentle spray from the hose. You don't want the water pressure or weight of the water to disturb your seeds, and drive them too deeply into the soil. Plant your pot in full sun, or for a longer season, give arugula mid day shade.\n        \n\nGrowing Arugula - Arugula doesn't love hot weather and gets quite bitter if grown when it's steaming hot outside.\n        \n\nStart arugula seeds as soon as danger of frost is over. Also, this is a great plant to sow once a week or every two weeks to keep a constant supply. Keep the soil evenly moist until seedlings emerge, which will take from 7 to 14 days. When the seedlings are about an inch or two tall, thin seedlings so they are one to three inches apart.\n        \n\nThese young leaves are some of the tenderest and most delicious, so add them to your salad. However, sometimes even if you don't bother thinning too much, the plants will grow ok even if they are bunched together.\n        \n\nHarvesting Arugula - Your arugula should be full grown and ready to harvest in about three to four weeks. The younger the leaves, the more tender and sweet they will be, so don't wait too long to start picking them. Once the seedlings are 3 to 4 inches long you can either pull out the whole plant or, if you want the plants to continue to grow, you can collect just the leaves by cutting or tearing them off towards their base. Beware if you pull out the plants as the dirt can get on the leaves. For clean leaves cut them and you won't have too much washing to do—just a rinse and they will be ready to go.\n\n\nSource: https://www.thespruce.com/growing-arugula-in-garden-pots-848160";

"puerro_desc" = "Leeks are members of the allium family of onions, in company with such vegetables as scallions, chives and green garlic. Leeks are an excellent choice for container gardening, and the sweet, mild flavor develops as well in containers as in a traditional garden. Create a successful crop of leeks from your container garden and enjoy fresh fall soups or add a hint of sweet flavor to fresh salads and other dishes.\n        \n\n<b>Starting Seeds</b>\n\n\n1. Start your leeks from seed 8 to 10 weeks before the last expected frost, typically mid to late fall. Fill a container at least six inches deep with a lightly acidic soil. Leeks thrive in soil with a pH of 6.0 to 6.8.\n\n\n2. Plant the seeds approximately 1/2-inch deep in the container. Keep the soil moist, watering the seeds regularly to keep the soil from drying out. Place your seedling container in an area with full sun, or at least eight hours of sunlight per day.\n\n\n3.  When the seedlings reach three inches tall, thin them out by pulling some seedlings out of the container until the remaining plants are an inch apart. Prepare your primary container when the seedlings reach six inches high. If you prefer to purchase leek seedlings, select seedlings that are at least six inches high when you are ready to plant.\n\n\n<b>Transplanting Seedlings</b>\n\n\n1. Transplant your seedlings to an outdoor container at least 10 inches deep when the overall temperatures average 50 degrees Fahrenheit during the day. Fill the container with an even mixture of 10-10-10 fertilizer and potting soil. Create six-inch deep spaces with a chopstick or similar tool. Place the seedlings six inches apart with 12 inches between the rows.\n\n\n2. Fill the holes and the areas around the seedlings with the soil mixture, smoothing the surface. Water the plants well once a week to keep the soil moist, but do not over water them. Keep the container in an area where the leeks will get full sun, or direct sunlight at least eight hours each day.\n\n\n3. Weed around the plants regularly, using caution not to disturb the growing leeks. Leeks are prone to being overtaken by weeds in the early stages, so careful weeding can ensure that the plants thrive.\n\n\n4. Mound the soil around the base of the leeks as they grow to lengthen the white stem portion of the plant.\n\n\n<b>Harvesting Leeks</b>\n\n\n1. Harvest young leeks as soon as they are large enough for your purposes, typically two to three months after you transplant them.\n\n\n2. Loosen the soil around the base of the leeks with a garden rake before you harvest them, to make it easier to pull them free of the soil without breakage.\n\n\n3. Harvest any overwintered leeks before the flower stalk is visible. Once the flower stalk appears, the leeks become tough, stringy and unappealing.\n   \n\nFuente: http://homeguides.sfgate.com/grow-leeks-containers-20974.html";

"habas_desc" = "Broad Beans can easily be grown in containers. Dwarf varieties such as Broad Bean ‘The Sutton' are ideal for growing on the patio. They have deep root systems so choose a deep container to accommodate them and be sure to keep them well watered throughout the growing season.\n        \n\nMany gardeners choose to direct sow broad bean seed either under cloches in late autumn or February, or without protection from March to April. Grow Broad beans in full sun on rich fertile, well-manured soil. Choose a sheltered position away from strong winds.\n\n\nPlant broad beans in double rows, set out at 23cm (9\") apart. Staggering these rows will help you make the most of the available space. You will need to allow at least 60cm (24\") between each set of double rows in order to access you crops.\n\n\nSow broad beans at a depth of 5cm (2\") deep and a distance of 23cm (9\") apart within each row and water well. Germination usually takes around 10 days.\n\n\nBroad Beans can be harvested and cooked as entire pods while they are immature at around 7.5cm (3\") long. However they are more usually harvested a little later than this, when the pods are well filled and the seed still soft. They can then be shelled and eaten as individual beans.\n\n\nSource: https://www.thompson-morgan.com/how-to-grow-broad-beans";

"patata_desc" = "Any container will do, from an old potato sack to big terracotta pot, but you want something sturdy. I have heard of bin bags being used successfully but ideally go for something a little more solid, as it will need to put up with some handling during growing time. It should also be as large a container as you can drum up: little pots will dry out much faster than big ones.\n        \n\nStart with a little compost in the base of your container, about 6-7in (15-17cm). I use spent compost from the previous year's pots of annuals. This is perfect as long as you remember that it doesn't contain any nutrients, and feed accordingly.\n\n\nAlthough you can grow any potatoes in pots, first and second earliest work best as they grow quickly and you can get them up and out of the pot by early summer, freeing up the pot for something else. Maincrop potatoes will work but they will be in the pots for a long time, requiring watering and attention all the while, and the results will be no different to those you could grow in the ground.\n\n\nWhichever your choice, place no more than three tubers into a 40L container and cover with a few inches of compost. A handful of organic slug pellets wouldn't hurt and you might also keep some horticultural fleece handy, should cold nights threaten.\n\n\nThe potatoes will need lots of water, regularly, to get off to a flying start. The green shoots will eventually poke up through the compost, and when they do, cover them with another layer of compost, water and feed, add compost, on and on, until you reach the top of the pot or bag.\n\n\nIn the ground, first earliest will take around 14 weeks to mature, second earliest around 16 weeks, but in warm containers you can knock a couple of weeks off that, particularly if you like to eat them tiny and tender. New potatoes are at their best eaten immediately, so pull out only what you want for one meal, leaving the rest to grow on. Rinse them off and throw them into a pan of boiling water and you may well decide to forsake your rows of maincrop spuds for a few pots of precious baby potatoes every year.\n\n\nSource: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/gardening/howtogrow/fruitandvegetables/11422293/How-to-grow-potatoes-in-pots.html";

"arandanos_desc" = "Blueberries are acid freaks—most need soil with a pH of 4.5 to 5.5 to thrive and produce berries. Most garden soil does not come close to these levels, and therein lies one of the main advantages to growing blueberries in containers. You can easily buy or create an acidic blueberry-friendly potting soil and your plants will thrive.\n        \n\nIf you've grown other fruit-bearing plants, you know that you're in it for the long haul. Your plants can happily produce fruit for years with very little care, but you'll want to start them off right. That means putting them in the largest pot that you can—at least 18 inches deep. Half-barrels and other deep, wide containers work well for the long-term.\n        \n\nFill your pot 2/3 full of your regular potting mix and the top third with a potting mix designed for acid-loving plants, like rhododendrons, azaleas, and camellias. You can find this at any nursery or garden center, and even in the houseplants section of some home centers. If you can't find a high-acid potting soil, you can mix in a fertilizer for acid-loving plants into your soil. I use Holly-Tone, by Epsoma.\n        \n\nBlueberries need full sun, as in a full 6 to 8 hours per day. In my experience, people often overestimate how much sun an area gets, so unless you are absolutely positive about it, take the time to accurately measure how much sun your plants are getting. Use a sun calculator, or simply use a watch and time the hours of full-sun exposure on a typical day during the growing season. On the flip side, If you live in an area that gets very hot afternoon sun, the plants can overheat, so watch out for this.\n        \n\nBlueberries need lots of water, but they also like sandy, well-draining soil. In other words, they don't like to be sitting in water, so try to keep the soil consistently moist, not soggy. When it rains, don't assume that you don't have to water. The leaves of the blueberry plant can act like an umbrella, shedding the water so that it misses the container completely. Always check the soil with your finger to see if it's wet below the surface. If you have to leave your blueberry plant and can't water it, make sure to move it to the shade to conserve water. It's also helpful to add a layer of compost with a topdressing of pine bark to help conserve water.\n        \n\nBlueberries don't like too much fertilizer. Twice a year in the early spring works well. For organic fertilizer, try blood or cottonseed meal or an organic fertilizer designed for ​acid-loving plants. Don't just fertilize and forget, however. Test the soil's pH regularly to keep the soil in the sweet spot for acid. Because acid washes out of soil over time, you might find that it's more effective to start with a half-dose of fertilizer in the spring, then add a light monthly dose throughout the season. Your soil tests should tell you what's best.\n        \n\nSource: https://www.thespruce.com/growing-blueberries-in-containers-848170";

"frambuesas_desc" = "Some raspberry varieties grow too large to easily grow in containers, but newer types, such as 'Heritage' or 'Raspberry Shortcake', a dwarf, thornless variety, are well suited to growing in large pots. If you choose another variety, be sure it is a fall-bearing type.\n        \n\nPlanting tips: Plant in a container that is at least 24-36 inches wide and deep. Half-barrels or five-gallon pots are ideal sizes that allow enough room for new canes to grow in future years. Start with 3-6 canes, depending on the size of the container.\n        \n\nSoil and fertilizer: Use a soilless potting mix for container raspberries. Add a balanced 10-10-10 timed-release fertilizer at planting time.\n        \n\nPruning and other care: Raspberries are perennials that usually set fruit on two-year-old canes. You might get some berries the first year you plant them but full bearing begins in year two. New green sprouts will grow to become fruiting canes for the following year. Prune all dead canes—ones with no new growth—at ground level.\n        \n\nWinter care: In regions with harsh winters, move the raspberry pots to an unheated garage, allowing the plants to go dormant but watering just enough to keep them alive. Return the pot to a sunny location after danger of frost passes. If you choose to leave the pot in place, insulate it with mulch for winter protection. Avoid using ceramic or terra-cotta pots outdoors year-round in cold climates as freeze-thaw cycles can crack those containers.\n        \n\nSource: https://www.bhg.com/gardening/container/plans-ideas/berries-in-containers/";
